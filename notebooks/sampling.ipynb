    "Parquet: Parquet is a columnar data format that is designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. Parquet files are smaller than CSV files, and they can be read and written much faster. Parquet files also support nested data structures, which makes them ideal for storing complex data.\n",

If you need to store large amounts of data and need to read and write the data quickly, then Parquet is a good choice. If you need to support a wide range of data processing frameworks and need to be able to debug the data easily, then CSV is a good choice."
